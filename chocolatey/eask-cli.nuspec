<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Dependency management for Emacs Lisp</summary>
    <description>Eask was built to use as a package development tool in your Elisp packages. But
now, Eask supports various types of Emacs Lisp tasks. It can be used in three
major ways:

1. Dev tool for Elisp packages
2. Dependency management for your configuration
3. Run elisp programs for all other purposes

So what are the major differences between Eask and other build tools like
[Cask][], [makem.sh][], and [Eldev][], other than the things above?

Good question! Eask is more than a build tool now, it can be used for various
purposes! But here are Eask aims to be:

- **Consistent** enough to sandbox across all systems
- **General** enough to have Emacsers frequently used commands (`byte-compile`, `checkdoc`, etc)
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of user errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the tool can be run on any platform

For more information, find the manual at https://emacs-eask.github.io/
